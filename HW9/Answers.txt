We were unable to instatiate an Object method... Yeah... The Object.java file was in the directory that you were working on (the desktop) and
you were trying to show us the native variable on the Object class so basically you were messing with the Object class. 

The reason why the code when the method notifyAll() is uncommented and without the synchronized keyword ends the program
when it's run is because notifyAll() throws an exception which throws it to main and it causes the code to end. The reason why it is throwing 
an exception is because one of the variables, product, which is a global boolean variable in the class economy is being accessed and modified 
silmutaneously by the different threads that are running and this causes an error. IllegalMonitorStateException is the exception being thrown.

To fix the code, we must put synchronized since that is the one of the purpose of the keyword because it acts as a lock controlling the 
access of each thread to our "shared" variable.
