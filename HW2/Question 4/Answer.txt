/* DON'T DO THIS ONE CUZ WE COVERED IT IN CLASS
Question 4:
Figure out why the following two pieces of code produce different outputs. 
MAKE SURE YOU CITE YOUR SOURCE FOR THE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION.

int x = 4282;
for(int i=0;i<35;i++){
	System.out.printf("%d\t\t%32s\n",i,Integer.toBinaryString(x>>>i);
}

VS

int x = 4282;
for(int i=0;i<35;i++){
	System.out.printf("%d\t\t%32s\n",i,Integer.toBinaryString(x));
	x = x >>> i;
}
