Question 6: In our class, we talked about how the Scanner class doesn't have a method 
for tokenizing individual characters. But you're hell bent on forcing the 
Scanner class to tokenize the individual characters. What should you set 
your delimiter to?

I will set my delimiter to something similar to: [\\p{javaWhitespace},',\",\\,]+
							^	      ^	^  ^
			For these marks, I will put each character that I will like to use as the delimiter

Old program from my CISC3120 class where the professor showed us how to add different delimiters into the Scanner class. + sign means all of them (I believe)
